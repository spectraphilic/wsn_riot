# LoRa E5

This document explains how to start working with the LoRa-E5 board from
SeedStudio. Links:

> ARM Cortex-M4 core and Semtech SX126X LoRa chip, supports both LoRaWAN and LoRa protocol
> on the worldwide frequency and (G)FSK, BPSK, (G)MSK, and LoRa modulations.

## Verify the hardware

The board comes with a firmware preinstalled that answers to AT commands. Before we
override this firmware forever, use it to verify the board is okay, and get some info that
*may* be needed later for LoRaWAN.

As explained in the official documentation from SeeedStudio
([here](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/LoRa_E5_mini/#getting-started)):

1. Plug the board to the computer with a USB cable
2. Open a serial terminal (e.g. Arduino's)
3. Set the baudrate to 9600
4. Type some AT commands. This is an example of the inpu/output:

       AT
       +AT: OK

       AT+ID
       +ID: DevAddr, 42:00:7E:D2
       +ID: DevEui, 2C:F7:F1:20:42:00:7E:D2
       +ID: AppEui, 80:00:00:00:00:00:00:06

In LoRaWAN networks, for OTAA activation, the device EUI (Extended Unique Identifier),
application EUI (aka JoinEUI), and application key are needed.

## The ST-Link programmer

To flash programs to the board a ST-Link v2 programmer is needed. Connect the
following pins, in the board and the programmer:

- GND
- SWCLK
- SWDIO
- RST

Some documents do not say to connect the reset pin (RST), but when I tried to
flash it didn't work if this pin was not connected.

## Disable Read Out Protection

By default it is not possible to flash programs, first the Read Out Protection
must be disabled.

First download the [STM32CubeProgrammer](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeprog.html#get-software)
and install it.

Next plug both the board and the ST-Link programmer to the computer with a
couple USB cables.

Start the STM32CubeProgrammer software.

Click the *Connect* button:

- If there's an error then press the reset button in the board, click the
  *Connect* button, and release the board's reset button.

- The *Log* box will display the message `Error: Data read failed`, but it's
  okay, don't worry about this message.

<img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/LoRa-E5_Development_Kit/wiki%20images/program1.png" width="800">

Now click the *OB* box in the left column, click on *Read Out Protection*, and
change the value to *AA*. Then click the *Apply* button.

## Flash a RIOT program

To flash a program from RIOT a recent enough version of OpenOCD must be
installed, version 0.11.0 worked for me:

    $ openocd --version
    Open On-Chip Debugger 0.11.0

If this is good, try flashing a RIOT program:

    $ BOARD=lora-e5-dev make -C examples/hello-world all flash term
    [...]

> **Note**
> Usually the first messages printed to the serial terminal are lost, so you may need to
> press the reset button after the program has been flashed, to see the whole sequence.

> **Note**
> It may also happen that you don't see anything at all even after pressing the reset
> button, this happens if the baudrate is incorrect. I had to pass `BAUD=115200` to be

## Testing

### LED and buttons

The mini board has one programmable LED (red) and one programmable button (Boot).
The development board has one more programmable button (D0).
We can use the `test/leds` program to test the LED and the *Boot* button:

    $ BOARD=lora-e5-dev make -C tests/leds all flash term
    [...]

First the LED will flick for a few seconds. Then it will light off, and while pressing the
*Boot* button it will light on.

Another program that can be tried is `test/buttons`, this will print a message every time
a button is pressed.

> **Warning**
> I have observed that `LED_OFF` switches **on** the LED, and `LED_ON` switches *off* the
> LED. **TODO** Submit an issue or pull-request to RIOT.

### Arduino

The `examples/arduino_hello-world/` will flicker the LED and echo anything typed in the
serial terminal.

The `tests/sys_arduino` program answers to a number of commands in the serial terminal:
`echo [...]`, `numb [...]`, `time` and `print`.

The `tests/periph_gpio_arduino/` program can be used for example to test the LED:

    > init_out 11
    > toggle 11

### I2C bus

In the development board, scanning the I2C bus with the `tests/periph_i2c` reveals a
device at address 0x48. This is the LM75 temperature sensor.

We can use the `tests/saul` program to verify the LM75 temperature sensor, and also
the programmable buttons (press a button to see the data line switch to 1):

    $ BOARD=lora-e5-dev make -C tests/saul all flash term

## LoRa

The chip has a SX126X module, so we can first test the sx126x driver:

    $ LORA_DRIVER=sx126x_stm32wl BOARD=lora-e5-dev make -C tests/driver_sx126x all flash term
    [...]
    > sx126x
    2022-11-04 10:18:53,948 # sx126x

    [...]
    > sx126x get type
    2022-11-04 13:08:38,601 # sx126x get type
    2022-11-04 13:08:38,601 # Device type: lora
    > sx126x set freq 865200000
    > sx126x set bw 125
    > sx126x set cr 1
    > sx126x set sf 12
    > sx126x rx start
    [...]
    > sx126x rx stop
    > sx126x tx "Hello"

> **Warning**
> The type must be `lora` not `fsk`. For this you must pass the
> `LORA_DRIVER=sx126x_stm32wl` option.

For pint-to-point communication we can mix a lora-e5 (SX126X) with a waspmote (SX1272),
the feather-m0 has as well a LoRa shield (SX1276):

    Mode 1
    BW 125
    CR 4/5
    SF 12

When sending "ping" command in the waspmote, I get this in the lora-e5:

    2022-11-04 13:06:47,702 # Received: "" (9 bytes) - [RSSI: -63, SNR: 6, TOA: 992ms]

### LoRaWAN

With `tests/gnrc_lorawan`:

    $ BOARD=lora-e5-dev make -C tests/gnrc_lorawan all flash term
    [...]
    2022-11-04 09:52:01,246 # - gnrc_lorawan_tests

With `tests/gnrc_lorawan_11`:

    $ BOARD=lora-e5-dev make -C tests/gnrc_lorawan_11 all flash term
    [...]
    2022-11-04 09:55:21,426 # - gnrc_lorawan_tests

    2022-11-04 09:55:21,454 # { "threads": [{ "name": "main", "stack_size": 1536, "stack_used": 900 }]}

To test LoRaWAN we can register to TTN (The Things Network), create a new application,
register our device

The use the `tests/pkg_semtech-loramac` program:

    $ LORA_DRIVER=sx126x_stm32wl BOARD=lora-e5-dev make -C tests/pkg_semtech-loramac all flash term
    [...]
    > loramac set deveui 2CF7F12042007ED2
    2022-11-04 12:47:32,365 # loramac set deveui 2CF7F12042007ED2
    > loramac set appeui 8000000000000006

## External modules

These are some modules we are trying.

> **Warning**
> This sections is still very much in progress!

### SHT31

- Temperature & humidity
- Address 0x44
- RIOT module sht3x

With the `tests/periph_i2c` we can confirm the I2C address is 0x44:

    > i2c_scan 0

### The DS1307 RTC

> **Warning**
> I ordered the wrong clock from SeeedStudio, a PCF85063TP which is close to the DS1307
> but not enough.

- Button battery CR1225
- Address 0x51

In RIOT the device address is hardcoded to 0x68, so the RIOT's source file
`drivers/include/ds1307.h` must be edited to change the address to 0x51:

    #define DS1307_I2C_ADDRESS      (0x51)

### SD card reader

The Adalogger FeatherWing includes:

- SD card reader
- RTC PCF8523 (I2C address 0x68)
- CR1220 button battery

See https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-adalogger-featherwing

> **Warning**
> The I2C address 0x68 is the same used by the DS3231 and DS1307.

> **Note**
> I tried with this module as well
> https://circuitstate.com/tutorials/interfacing-catalex-micro-sd-card-module-with-arduino/
> but it didn't work. Apparently the pins value are at 5V, designed for Arduino, so it
> does not work with 3V3 MCUs.

### SDI-12

Tested RIOT's `tests/pkg_arduino_sdi_12` program with the Decagon CTD-10 sensor, which
uses 5V power.  Only needed to change the pin in the `main.c` file, to use pin 21 instead
of 13.

> **Warning**
> The board is not compatible with Arduino, but support for Arduino in RIOT was added to
> it. This means that the pin numbers do not match those of Arduino. The exact definition
> of the Arduino pin numbers for the lora-e5-dev board can be found in
> `boards/lora-e5-dev/include/arduino_pinmap.h`. Here we use pin 21 which in the board is
> labelled as **D9**.
