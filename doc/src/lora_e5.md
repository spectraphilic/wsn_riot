This document explains how to start working with the LoRa-E5 board from
SeedStudio. Links:

## Verify the hardware

Before starting it's probably good to verify the board is okay. As explained in
the official documentation from SeeedStudio
([here](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/LoRa_E5_mini/#getting-started)):

1. Plug the board to the computer with a USB cable
2. Open a serial terminal (e.g. Arduino's)
3. Set the baudrate to 9600
4. Type some AT commands. This is an example of the inpu/output:

       AT
       +AT: OK

       AT+ID
       +ID: DevAddr, 42:00:7E:D2
       +ID: DevEui, 2C:F7:F1:20:42:00:7E:D2
       +ID: AppEui, 80:00:00:00:00:00:00:06

## The ST-Link programmer

To flash programs to the board a ST-Link v2 programmer is needed. Connect the
following pins, in the board and the programmer:

- GND
- SWCLK
- SWDIO
- RST

Some documents do not say to connect the reset pin (RST), but when I tried to
flash it didn't work if this pin was not connected.

## Disable Read Out Protection

By default it is not possible to flash programs, first the Read Out Protection
must be disabled.

First download the [STM32CubeProgrammer](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeprog.html#get-software)
and install it.

Next plug both the board and the ST-Link programmer to the computer with a
couple USB cables.

Start the STM32CubeProgrammer software.

Click the *Connect* button:

- If there's an error then press the reset button in the board, click the
  *Connect* button, and release the board's reset button.

- The *Log* box will display the message `Error: Data read failed`, but it's
  okay, don't worry about this message.

Now click the *OB* box in the left column, click on *Read Out Protection*, and
change the value to *AA*. Then click the *Apply* button.

## Flash a RIOT program

To flash a program from RIOT a recent enough version of OpenOCD must be
installed, version 0.11.0 worked for me:

    $ openocd --version
    Open On-Chip Debugger 0.11.0

If this is good, try flashing a RIOT program:

    $ BOARD=lora-e5-dev make -C examples/hello-world all flash term
    [...]

> **Note**
> Usually the first messages printed to the serial terminal are lost, so you may need to
> press the reset button after the program has been flashed, to see the whole sequence.

> **Note**
> It may also happen that you don't see anything at all even after pressing the reset
> button, this happens if the baudrate is incorrect. I had to pass `BAUD=115200` to be
> able to send/receive messages with the serial terminal.


## Testing

### LED and buttons

The mini board has one programmable LED (red) and one programmable button (Boot).
The development board has one more programmable button (D0).
We can use the `test/leds` program to test the LED and the *Boot* button:

    $ BOARD=lora-e5-dev make -C tests/leds all flash term
    [...]

First the LED will flick for a few seconds. Then it will light off, and while pressing the
*Boot* button it will light on.

Another program that can be tried is `test/buttons`, this will print a message every time
a button is pressed.

### Arduino

The `examples/arduino_hello-world/` will flicker the LED and echo anything typed in the
serial terminal.

The `tests/sys_arduino` program answers to a number of commands in the serial terminal:
`echo [...]`, `numb [...]`, `time` and `print`.

The `tests/periph_gpio_arduino/` program can be used for example to test the LED:

    > init_out 11
    > toggle 11

### I2C bus

In the development board, scanning the I2C bus with the `tests/periph_i2c` reveals a
device at address 0x48. This is the LM75 temperature sensor.

We can use the `tests/saul` program to verify the LM75 temperature sensor, and also
the programmable buttons (press a button to see the data line switch to 1):

    $ BOARD=lora-e5-dev make -C tests/saul all flash term
