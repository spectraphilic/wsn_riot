# Howto Networking

Test RE-Mote to XBee communication works.
Use XCTU with XBee dongle.

- Be sure to plug an antenna on both modules
- Use XBEE PRO 802.15.4 firmware
- Set same channel (CH) and network id (ID) on both modules
- Set MAC mode (MM) *without* MaxStream (1 or 2)
- Set API enabled (AP), this will be needed when using Python
